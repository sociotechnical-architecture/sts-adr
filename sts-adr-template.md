# STS-ADR Template

This is the template in Documenting SocioTechnical Systems Architecture Decision Records (STS-ADRs). It addresses the same base idea as original ADRs but extended to systematically consider the key dimensions of  SocioTechnical Systems Architecture evolution (namely the ones introduced in the SPS thinking model: Systems, Phases & Scopes).

Each STS-ADR focuses on one decision (which in this case may have consequences in multiple related systems).

In each STS-ADR file, write these sections.

## Title

> descriptive title

## Status

> the status of the decision "proposed", "accepted", "deprecated" or "superseded"

## Scope

> the scope where the decision is to be made, e.g.: team | product | product group | enterprise

## Trigger

> what challenge or opportunity are we noticing to trigger a possible evolution

## Context

> what is the context of the different sub-systems, scope and interrelated scopes

## Synthesis & understanding

> given the trigger challenge & context from parts, perform synthesis (holistically) with the goal of understanding and formulating a suitable hypothesis of evolution

## Decision

> given the hypothesis formulated, what is the decision we make and the actions we take per each sub-system in the scope

## Consequences

> given the decision made and actions taken on each sub-system in the scope, what are the expected consequences on each of those sub-systems in the scope and furthermore possible consequences in interrelated scopes
