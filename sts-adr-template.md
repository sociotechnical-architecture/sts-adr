# STS-ADR Template

This is the template in Documenting SocioTechnical Systems - Architecture Decision Records (STS-ADRs). It addresses the same base idea as original ADRs but extended to systematically consider the key dimensions of  SocioTechnical Systems evolution (namely the ones introduced in the SES thinking model: Systems, Evolution & Scopes).

Each STS-ADR focuses on one key topic and decision, which happens in a given context and scope. The goal is that before taking a decision, there is a synthesis and understanding from an holistic perspective. From that, hypothesis are formulated and decisions are taken, which will lead to actions on the different systems (Product, People and Technology) in that scope and possibly other related scopes.

In each STS-ADR file, write these sections.

## Title

> descriptive title

## Status

> the status of the decision "development", "proposed", "accepted", "deprecated" or "superseded"

## Scope

> the scope where the decision is to be made, e.g.: team | product | product group | enterprise

## Trigger

> what challenge or opportunity are we noticing to trigger a possible evolution

## Context

> what is the context of the different sub-systems (Product(What), Teams(Who), Tech(How)), scope and interrelated scopes

## Synthesis & understanding

> given the trigger challenge (or vision) and context from parts, perform synthesis (holistically) with the goal of understanding and formulating vision and suitable hypothesis of evolution

## Decision

> given the hypothesis formulated, what is the decision we make and the actions we take per each sub-system in the scope

## Consequences

> given the decision made what are the expected consequences on in each of the sub-systems in the scope (Product(What), Teams(Who), Tech(How)). Furthermore possible consequences in interrelated scopes
