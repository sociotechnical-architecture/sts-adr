# SocioTechnical Systems - Architecture Decision Records (STS-ADR)

This repository introduces SocioTechnical Systems Architecture Decision Records (STS-ADR). STS-ADRs build upon the original [Architecture Decision Record (ADR)](https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) introduced by Michael Nygard, but extend them with some elements that enable to more systematically address key considerations and dimensions to approach sociotechnical systems architecture evolution. 

> **WIP**: this repo is Work-In-Progress! You can find the very first version draft version of the template here: [sts-adr-template.md](https://github.com/sociotechnical-architecture/sts-adr/sts-adr-template.md) Feel free to send feedback (as [Issues](https://github.com/sociotechnical-architecture/sts-adr/issues/new/choose)). However, keep in mind that it may still lack some context and guidelines to be used. We are working on materials to properly introduce the template and provide guidelines to effectively use it. This work is based on ideas and a thinking model [Eduardo da Silva](https://esilva.net) has been exploring to approach Sociotechnical Systems Architecture evolution (find related resources here: [esilva.net/sociotechnical](https://esilva.net/sociotechnical)).
